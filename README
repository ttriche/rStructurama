This is a first stab at integrating Structurama as a workflow into R.

I'm not about to fire up a separate program to find out whether AML patients 
have radically different background mutation rates by population, but if it 
were as easy as feeding SAM/BAM files to an existing workflow... well, you 
probably get the idea.

I'm unspeakably lazy but I do like Dirichlet processes, and there you go.
